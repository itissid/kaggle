What is this?
-------------

This is a project that contains some work for my work on the Kaggle [Zillow contest](https://www.kaggle.com/c/zillow-prize-1). It took me sometime to get my work into these notebooks and properly formatted. There are 3 more I want to put in including soe work on Feature Engineering, Random Forests and on Adaptive Nearest Neighbors.
